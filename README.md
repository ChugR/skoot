# skoot

Simple script for generating configurations for a network of clusters.

1. cd python/tools
2. source export_path.sh
3. skoot -c <network-description-file> -o <directory-for-yaml-configs> (example network config can be found in the network-configs folder).
4. The skoot tool (for now) can only be executed from the python/tools folder
